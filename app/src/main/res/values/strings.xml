Built on the former Railway Lands, it was completed in 1976, and held the record for the world\'s tallest free-standing structure for 32 years from 1975–2007 and was the world\'s tallest tower until 2009 being overtaken by Burj Khalifa and Canton Tower, respectively. It is now the third tallest tower in the world and remains the tallest free-standing structure in the Western Hemisphere, a signature icon of Toronto\'s skyline, attracting more than two million international visitors annually</string>
    <string name="empire_state_text">The Empire State Building is a 102-story skyscraper on Fifth Avenue between West 33rd and 34th Streets in Midtown, Manhattan, New York City. It has a roof height of 1,250 feet (381 m), and with its antenna included, it stands a total of 1,454 feet (443.2 m) tall.[7] Its name is derived from the nickname for New York, the Empire State.

The Empire State Building is currently the fifth-tallest completed skyscraper in the United States and the 35th-tallest in the world. It is also the fifth-tallest freestanding structure in the Americas. When measured by pinnacle height, it is the fourth-tallest building in the United States.</string>
    <string name="golden_gate_text">The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate, the one-mile-wide (1.6 km) strait connecting San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean. The structure links the American city of San Francisco, California – the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula – to Marin County, carrying both U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1 across the strait. The bridge is one of the most internationally recognized symbols of San Francisco, California, and the United States. It has been declared one of the Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The Frommer\'s travel guide describes the Golden Gate Bridge as possibly the most beautiful, certainly the most photographed, bridge in the world. It opened in 1937 and was, until 1964, the longest suspension bridge main span in the world, at 4,200 feet (1,280 m)</string>
    <string name="itaipuDam_text">Itaipu Dam is a hydroelectric dam located on the border of Paraguay and Brazil. The resource used to run this dam is the Parana River, which forms a natural barrier between the two countries. The plan for a hydro-generating plant, using the Parana River as its source of energy, began in the 1960s. In the 1980s the dam was officially opened. The American Society of Civil Engineers considered the Itaipu Dam to be such an amazing achievement that they listed it as one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World.</string>
    <string name="delta_works">Because the Netherlands is one of the most low-lying countries in the world, its people have struggled every time a storm raises the water levels. As far back as the first century A.D. the inhabitants of this area have attempted to protect themselves from the devastation the rising water levels have caused. The Zuiderzee was originally a shallow bay in the North Sea. It was about 30 miles wide and reached 60 miles inland. Although it was a large bay it was only about 15 feet deep. Every time there was a storm, dikes failed and the land was flooded.</string>
    <string name="panama_canal">The Panama Canal connects the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. It is a 48 mile canal that is important for international maritime trade. Construction of the canal began in 1881by France, but there were engineering problems and too many people were dying due to disease. Construction stopped until the US took over in 1904. They took 10 years to complete the canal. The canal allowed ships to travel between the two oceans more safely and in half the time. In 1999 the Panamanian government took control of the canal. The Panama Canal is one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World.</string>
    <string name="victory_falls">Victoria Falls is one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World and the major waterfall on the Zambezi River in Africa. It is famous for being the largest waterfall in the world, in the wet season. The African people who live around the falls call it Mosi-oa-Tunya which means smoke that thunders. The water makes a roaring noise as it falls over the cliff and down into the Zambezi River below. A cloud of water vapor is always seen around the falls.</string>
    <string name="barrier_reef">The Great Barrier Reef is one of the seven wonders of the natural world. It is the world\'s largest coral reef system and the only living structure seen from space. The coral reef is like a city of separate homes made by tiny sea creatures called coral polyps.</string>

    <string name="northern_lights">At the North and South Magnetic Poles of our planet Earth, we see the sky light up, flash and shimmer. We call this effect an aurora. In the northern hemisphere it is called the Aurora borealis, also known as the Northern Lights. In the southern hemisphere, it is called Aurora australis, also known as the Southern Lights.</string>
    <string name="grand_canyon">The Grand Canyon is in the United States of America. Millions of years ago, instead of a deep canyon, this area was a giant flat slab of layered rock that we call the Colorado Plateau. Rain and melted snow forming the Colorado River have flowed over this plateau for millions of years, cutting into the rock surface and forming the Grand Canyon.</string>

    <string name="chichén_itzá">Chichén Itzá is possibly the most famous temple city of the Mayas, a pre-Columbian civilization that lived in present day Central America. It was the political and religious center of Maya civilization during the period from A.D. 750 to 1200. At the city\'s heart lies the Temple of Kukulkan (pictured)—which rises to a height of 79 feet (24 meters). Each of its four sides has 91 steps—one step for each day of the year, with the 365th day represented by the platform on the top. The New7Wonders competition was launched in 1999, and the voting process beginning in 2005. Nearly 200 nominations that came in from around the world were narrowed down to 21.

    <string name="machu_piccu">One of three successful candidates from Latin America, Machu Picchu is a 15th-century mountain settlement in the Amazon region of Peru. The ruined city is among the best known remnants of the Inca civilization, which flourished in the Andes region of western South America. The city is thought to have been abandoned following an outbreak of deadly smallpox, a disease introduced in the 1500s by invading Spanish forces. Hundreds of people gathered at the remote, 7,970-foot-high (2,430-meter-high) site on Saturday to celebrate Machu Picchu\'s new seven wonders status. The winners were revealed at a soccer stadium in the Portuguese capital, Lisbon, where Machu Picchu reportedly got one of the biggest cheers. The other two Latin American selections were Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and Chichén Itzá, Mexico.</string>
    <string name="petra">Perched on the edge of the Arabian Desert, Petra was the capital of the Nabataean kingdom of King Aretas IV (9 B.C. to A.D. 40). Petra is famous for its many stone structures such as a 138-foot-tall (42-meter-tall) temple carved with classical facades into rose-colored rock. The ancient city also included tunnels, water chambers, and an amphitheater, which held 4,000 people. The desert site wasn\'t known to the West until Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt came across it in 1812. Jordan has taken the New7Wonders competition seriously. Petra is an important attraction in a country where tourism has recently suffered due to troubles in the Middle East region, particularly in neighboring Iraq. The Jordanian royal family backed a campaign promoting Petra\'s selection.</string>
    <string name="colosseum">The only finalist from Europe to make it into the top seven—the Colosseum in Rome, Italy—once held up to 50,000 spectators who came to watch gory games involving gladiators, wild animals, and prisoners. Construction began around A.D. 70 under Emperor Vespasian. Modern sports stadiums still resemble the Colosseum\'s famous design. European sites that didn\'t make the cut include Stonehenge in the United Kingdom, the Acropolis in Athens, Greece, and the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France. The Vatican in Rome accused the competition\'s organizers of ignoring Christian monuments, none of which was featured among the 20 finalists. Archbishop Mauro Piacenza, head of culture and archaeology at the Vatican, called the omission of sites such as the Sistine Chapel inexplicable.</string>
    <string name="great_wall">This newly elected world wonder was built along China\'s northern border over many centuries to keep out invading Mongol tribes. Constructed between the fifth century B.C. and the 16th century, the Great Wall is the world\'s longest human-made structure, stretching some 4,000 miles (6,400 kilometers). The best known section was built around 200 B.C. by the first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang Di. The wall was among the winners of the New7Wonders poll announced during a televised ceremony in Lisbon, Portugal. However the Chinese state broadcaster chose not to broadcast the event, and Chinese state heritage officials refused to endorse the competition. It was a different story for some of the other candidates. In Brazil, for example, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva encouraged his compatriots to vote for Rio de Janeiro\'s mountaintop statue of Jesus Christ.</string>
    <string name="christ_statue">The 105-foot-tall (38-meter-tall) Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, was among the new seven wonders of the world announced July 7 following a global poll to decide a new list of human-made marvels. The winners were voted for by Internet and phone, American Idol style. The other six new wonders are the Colosseum in Rome, India\'s Taj Mahal, the Great Wall of China, Jordan\'s ancient city of Petra, the Inca ruins of Machu Picchu in Peru, and the ancient Maya city of Chichén Itzá in Mexico. The contest was organized by the New7Wonders Foundation—the brainchild of Swiss filmmaker and museum curator Bernard Weber—in order to protect humankind\'s heritage across the globe. The foundation says the poll attracted almost a hundred million votes. Yet the competition has proved controversial, drawing criticism from the United Nations\' cultural organization UNESCO, which administers the World Heritage sites program (pictures of the newest World Heritage sites). This initiative cannot, in any significant and sustainable manner, contribute to the preservation of sites elected by the public, UNESCO said in a statement.</string>
